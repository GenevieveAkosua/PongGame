# PongGame

## Description
This is a dual-player Pong game made in Python. It's a very simple program that sticks true to the original Pong game that people know and love. I made this by following a tutorial by [Tech with Tim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVGTZlnnX3U). If you'd like to learn a bit about game-creation, physics simulations (in particular collisions), and a bit of trig, this is the perfect project to try.

## What I used
I used:
1. Python

Have Fun!
